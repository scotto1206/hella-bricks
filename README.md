# Hella Bricks

www.hellabricks.com

This site is a project with the aim to become a review, build video, and news site for LEGO sets.

I built out the landing page with the GatsbyJS framework. 

Additionally, I am working to get the Headless CMS configured and page components to a place where I can make posts.
